map in arrays
    transform or extract data from list of objects.
    return value or an object which has to be present in the resultant 
    array.

filter in arrays
    to extract set of objects matching the criteria
    function has to sent as parameter which will return a boolean, which will
    return true if element has to be included.


forEach in arrays
    can be used to perform particular operation on each array element

default value for function parameters introduced in es6 it can used for
primitives and objects

syntax function(x=5,y=6){
    //return something
}

//es 5 way
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,logAllArguments.length)
call is used on array like objects but not arrays.
to transform result into a array.

//rest parameters for functions
usage function (x,...restParams){
    //all the extra params passed will be there in 
    // rest params which is array
}

//constructor functions ;

function NewObject(objparam1,objparam2)
{
    this.something1=objparam1;
    this.something2=objparam2;
}

objinst1 = new NewObject(1,2);
objinst2 = new NewObject(3,4);

//constructor functions cannot be declared with arrow function.

//arrow funtions doesnt create a new context .
//while it is getting executed
//they inherit the context from where they are getting executed.
